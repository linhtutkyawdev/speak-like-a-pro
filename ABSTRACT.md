# Speak Like a Pro: Your path to confident English speaking

Speak Like a Pro is a comprehensive web application meticulously designed to address the critical need for effective English speaking practice. Recognizing that traditional methods often lack interactive and personalized feedback, this platform provides a dynamic and engaging environment for learners of all levels. The core functionality revolves around structured courses, accessible after user authentication, which guide individuals through carefully curated sentences and conversational structures.

A key innovation of Speak Like a Pro is its integration of the Web Speech API, enabling real-time speech-to-text conversion. This allows users to speak the provided sentences into their microphone and receive immediate, objective feedback on their pronunciation and fluency. This interactive element transforms passive learning into active practice, fostering rapid improvement and building confidence.

The project is built using a modern technology stack, featuring React and TypeScript for a robust and scalable frontend user interface. The backend is powered by Convex, a real-time database and serverless functions platform, which facilitates seamless data synchronization and efficient handling of user progress, course content, and authentication.

Speak Like a Pro offers a personalized learning path, adapting to the user's progress and providing targeted practice. By combining structured content with cutting-edge speech recognition technology and a modern development stack, Speak Like a Pro provides a powerful and effective tool for anyone looking to achieve fluency and confidence in spoken English. This project serves as a practical demonstration of how technology can be leveraged to create impactful educational tools.
